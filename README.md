This is my CS50P Python final project.

It is a web application that scrapes job boards and aggregates the results for CodeCamp friendly positions that are available in a set location.

There is a dictionary of keywords that can be edited to help expand or narrow the search done by the web scraper.

To run the Python web application locally, navigate to the project directory in the terminal, then execute the command python app.py (where "app.py" is the name of the Python file containing the web application logic), which will start a local server; you can then access the application in a web browser by going to http://localhost:5000 (or the specified port number in your terminal).
